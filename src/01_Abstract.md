# Abstract

 
 
## Outline (TODO: remove)

- Abstract
    - trailer of what you did, why it was cool and what you learned)
    - 
- Introduction // first paragraph part should look a lot like first paragraphs of delite papers
    - Start general (talk about programming language evolutions over the years)
    - Talk about abstraction
    - Talk about delite and how it is great and allows you to do cool things
    - Talk about loop fusion and Soa
    - on the way to loop fusion we discovered and adressed a need for better debugging / visualisation tools

- Background // and related work
    - Keep it short for each project
    - Use all of the references
    - talk about delite
    - lms
    - parallel patterns
    - optimizations - soa
    - optimizations - loop fusion

- Implementation
    - Parallel patterns in Delite
    - parts of what is currently in Background
    - what's wrong with old loop fusion
    - go into details of what had to be changed
    - How it used to be , how it is now

Evaluation

- amount of stuff that compiles -> was broken, is fixed
- benchmarks with and wihtout certain optimizations -> was slow, is fast

Future Work

- Lowering code to loop language -> mirror Introduction
- Debugging and tooling future for staged programs (if I have time, find people who did simliar things )

Conclusion

- abstract + first paragraph of intro
